Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if provided by\r\n * the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.\r\n *\r\n * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\r\n * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\r\n * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\r\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\r\n *\r\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\r\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\r\n *\r\n * To optimize glass rendering performance, onShouldVirtualize can be set. When onShouldVirtualize return false,\r\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time. And we\r\n * start doing measurements and rendering in virtualized mode when items grows larger than this threshold.\r\n *\r\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\r\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow.
