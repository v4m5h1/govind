/**

 *
 * @remarks
 * Extend this class to create dialogs for SharePoint Framework. By following the guidelines in implementation,
 * the framework can ensure that the dialogs are shown in a user-friendly manner. While the content of the dialog is
 * controlled by this class by implementing the render method, the framework can decide when to show the dialog and
 * how to render the overlay and modal. The application on the page can also have control on allowing dialogs to show.
 * Refer to the documentation of the individual methods and properties to learn more about how to extend and use this
 * class.

     * Constructor for the `BaseDialog` class.
     * @remarks
     *
     * It is important to keep the constructor lightweight. Use `onBeforeOpen()` for doing heavy-weight initialization
     * that is needed for rendering the dialog such as resource allocations and asynchronous calls to fetch data. You
     * can use the constructor to set initial parameters of your dialog such as references to resources in your
     * application. The reason for this is that dialogs are usually constructed upon a UI event e.g. a button click,
     * but the dialog may not always be shown right after construction. Keeping the constructor lightweight ensures
     * smooth user experience and avoids doing throw-away work in case the dialog is not shown later e.g. if
     * the framework rejects it. Another benefit of doing this is avoiding memory leaks by doing all the allocations and
     * disposals in symmetric `onBeforeOpen()` and `onAfterClose()` events. If you allocate resources in the
     * constructor, you have a memory leak because there is no guarantee onAfterClose() will get called,
     * and onAfterClose() is your only opportunity to dispose.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     *   constructor(cacheReference: any) {
     *     super();
     *
     *     this._cache = cacheReference; // This is okay. Keeping a reference to my internal cache.
     *     this._cache.refresh(); // This is bad practice.
     *     // If you need to refresh the cache (or fetch data) for rendering, do it in onBeforeOpen()
     *   }
