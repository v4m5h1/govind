 * to subscribe to a SharePoint Framework event:  It must have instanceId and componentId
 * information for diagnostics reporting, and it must have a way to notify the event system
 * when the component is disposed, so that its handlers can be automatically removed.
 * Other objects may implement this contract, as long as they meet these requirements.
